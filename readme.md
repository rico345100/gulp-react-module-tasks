# gulp-react-module-tasks
Common tasks for create react modules with Gulp + Browserify.

## What is this?
This is the template for building React Module with Gulp and Browserify. Only you need is configure the gulpfile.js to your needs, and then start the gulp to build it.

```bash
$ npm install
// after module wrote,
$ gulp
```

## There is only one task!
You can extend gulpfile.js in this template as much as you need, it is just minial setting for building React Component.
However, I will add some more features like disk/memory caching for faster builds and other common things like uglify.
